## Issue Tracking

This project uses [bd (beads)](https://github.com/cased/bd) for issue tracking.

Quick reference:
- `bd ready` - Find unblocked work
- `bd create "Title"` - Create new issue
- `bd close <id>` - Complete work

## Starting New Work

1. Write your spec in `SPEC.md`
2. Ask Claude to "process the spec" or "break down SPEC.md into tasks"
3. Review the proposed task breakdown
4. Approve to create bd tasks
5. Run `bd ready` to see what to work on first
